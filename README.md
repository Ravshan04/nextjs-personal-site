# nextjs-personal-site

This is my personal portfolio. I made this using the new App router for nextjs, so it might still be a bit buggy!

## Description

I wanted to completely redesign my portfolio, and more importantly try out the new Next App router. I also wanted to experiment with using React Three Fiber in an application as well. All in all I loved making this and think it came out looking really good! Definitely need to improve the performance, think it's mainly the React Three Fiber that is causing a heavy load.

### What did I Learn üè´

The app router is the main thing I wanted to learn, and specifically how to use 3D models on a website.

I also learned how to use:

- TypeScript in a react/next application.
- React Three Drei.
- Import Types for TypeScript.
- Deepened my knowledge of Framer Motion.
- React Hook Form
