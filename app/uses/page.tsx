              I have a logicbook for work on the go, but I absolutely love
              having a desktop. I've always been a massive fan of building my
              own PC, plus it's handy for when I have the time to game. It's
              also fair to say that my PC looks like a unicorn has vomited on
              the inside with all the RGB I installed ü§£ü¶Ñ.

              I got this behemoth monitor in 2022. The range of colors on it are
              fantastic and it's super HiDPI. Absolutely love using it, for
              design or building out UI.

              Sticking in the fashion of a true unicorn lover I have an RGB
              keyboard as well. It's big and bulky but I always prefer that to
              smaller keyboards.

              I don't have as much time for games as I used to, plus I'm not
              really an FPS guy as so this never came in handy. But it's got a
              nice weight to it and a great feeling the hand. Good for raiding
              in MMOs though üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

              is a great choice üëè. Super comfortable for the price. It's

              Atom was the code editor I first cut my teeth on, when I was
              learning Python. Now it's visual studio code. I have the VIM
              extension installed, as I'm debating swapping out either NeoVim or
              Vim. Vim motions definitely improve productivity a tonne.

              Powershell was the bane of my life for so long. I've got PopOS
              installed on a second SSD as I was using it to learn linux. So I
              became comfortable using bash commands. Thankfully windows shipped
              their new terminal and it's great. I can run whatever kind of
              shell I'd like and customize it to my hearts desire.

              I started learning how to use figma over two years ago. I was
              always struggling to make my designs look sleek and sophisticated.
              But thanks to figma, It's helped me rapidly design sites that look
              most bodacious ü§ü.

              Use it whenever I need to edit logos or pictures. I mean most
